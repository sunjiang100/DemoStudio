This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB1700 Evaluation Board' with 
'NXP LPC1768' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 2 controller every 1 second
 - display received byte on CAN 1 controller in hexadecimal 
   representation on 4 LEDs
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer (AD0.2) 
and watch the value on 4 LEDs change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)
